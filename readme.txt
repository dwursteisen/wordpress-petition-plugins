WordPress Petition Plugin
http://www.freecharity.org.uk/wordpress-petition-plugin/

Installation

   1. Download and unzip the plugin. Upload the unzipped folder to the
   wp-contents/plugins folder of your WordPress installation.
   2. Enable the plugin from the WordPress Plugins administration page.

Configuration

   1. The petition is configured through the "Petition" page under
   Options. There are only a few options to be set. The details on the page,
   and the default settings should explain the options to you.
   2. When setting the confirmation e-mail text, placing [[curl]] within the
   text will insert the confirmation URL at that point in the text. Failure to
   place the URL within the text will result in a useless confirmation e-mail.
   3. Within the post or page where you wish the petition to appear, insert
   [[petition]]. The petition will not appear until you enable the petition on
   the options page.

Managing your petition

The data gathered by the petition can be managed from the "Petition"
page under Manage.

   * The entire petition can be wiped using the button on the upper right of
     the page.
   * Individual signatures can be deleted or manually confirmed from within the
     table.
