Run a simple web and e-mail based petition through WordPress.

== Description ==

The plugin allows you to run a single petition through your WordPress installation. The petition appears on a page or post in WordPress. Upon submitting their details the user is sent an e-mail, prompting them to confirm their signature. The may can leave an optional comment if required. Details of signatories can be exported when the petition is complete.

== Installation ==

1. Download and unzip the plugin. Upload the unzipped folder to the wp-contents/plugins folder of your WordPress installation.
2. Enable the plugin from the WordPress Plugins administration page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the plugin? =

1. The petition is configured through the "Petition" page under Options. There are only a few options to be set. Combined with the default options, you should need little assistance with theses.
2. When setting the confirmation e-mail text, placing [[curl]] within the text will insert the confirmation URL at that point in the text. Failure to place the URL within the text will result in a useless confirmation e-mail.
3. Within the post or page where you wish the petition to appear, insert [[petition]]. The petition will not appear until you enable the petition on the options page.

= How can I manage the petition data? =

The data gathered by the petition can be managed from the "Petition"
page under Manage.

* The entire petition can be wiped using the button on the upper right of the page.
* Individual signatures can be deleted or manually confirmed from within the table.
